      <p>Hey, I'm Bart.</p>
      <p>I'm a registered Chartered Accountant and Tech Enthusiast.</p>
      <p>From a young age I've always been intrigued about computer science and technology. After school I obtained both
        Bachelors and Honours degrees in Accounting, after which I gained invaluable experience as an auditor for the
        next 4 and a half years of my life.</p>
      <p>I've always been interested in automating workflows for finanace related obstacles. When I'm not spending time
        with family or friends, I navigate towards doing research and playing around with code on the computer. See some
        of the projects I've completed in my <a href="https://github.com/bartventer?tab=repositories">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
      <p>Feel free to <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">get in touch</a> if you would like to colloborate with me in
        the future.</p>
